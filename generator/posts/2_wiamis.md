Recently, I was in Paris for a conference to introduce an image description algorithm that I developed. Actually, it’s been quite a while (almost a month) since the conference was held, but I haven’t got a chance share my notes earlier. Here are some notes from the 14<sup>th</sup> International Workshop on Image and Audio Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services (WIAMIS’13).

The first keynote speech was given by François Pachet. He introduced a style-imitating sequence generation method. He talked about several projects that he is involved in, including the Flow Machines, Continuator, and Virtual Band. Some of the demos are available at the following links.

There were several interesting presentations and demos at the conference. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any video demonstrations of the most of the projects on the web. Here is one demonstration video that I found:

At the special session on visual attention, I presented my paper, titled “Affine Invariant Salient Patch Descriptors for Image Retrieval.” The algorithm that I’ve presented simply fits concentric ellipses to the most salient region –the salient patch– on an input image and characterizes the image by extracting affine invariant features from the salient patch. The paper is available at the following link:

At the and of the first day, there was a jazz-themed welcome reception. I was quite surprised when I saw the general chair of the conference, Gael Richard, playing in the Jazz band.

The final social event of the conference was a visit of the Musée d’Orsay and a banquet in the museum restaurant.

Paris was a great city! Thankfully, I had enough time to explore the city and its surroundings before and during the conference. However, I recommend anyone who plans to visit Paris (or any other metropolitan city) not to rely on buses due to unexpected traffic jams. Thankfully, I was able to catch my flight 5 minutes prior to departure. The rail system is way more precise and reliable...
