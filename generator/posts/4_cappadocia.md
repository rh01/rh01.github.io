After a 9-hour bus ride from Istanbul, I arrived at Cappadocia. With its unique landscape, it's a great place to visit and shoot timelapse videos. 

My first stop in Cappadocia was [Urgup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Crg%C3%BCp){: target="_blank"}, where I joined my friends. We spent the first day in Urgup shooting timelapse videos. You can watch the footage above. (Also, check out my friend's [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/absancakli){: target="_blank"} page for more.)

Next day, we headed to [Avanos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avanos){: target="_blank"}, which is a town famous for pottery. Many pottery shop owners offer demonstrations and introduction classes for a small fee. We visited some of the pottery shops and watched the demonstrations.

We camped the night in Pasabag valley, a place where we could find one of the best collection of [fairy chimneys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_%28geology%29){: target="_blank"} in the site. It was dark and quiet at night. There were not many artificial light sources in the neighborhood. So, it was also a good place to observe the Milky Way with the naked eye. We were even able to capture the movements of stars in our timelapse videos (after 0:47 in the video).

Just before the sunrise, we saw hot air balloons rising behind the hills and filling the sky. There were approximately 40 â€“ 50 balloons in the air flying over the fairy chimneys (0:30 - 0:45 in the video).

One of the must visit places in Cappadocia is the [Goreme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6reme){: target="_blank"} Open Air Museum, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The museum consists of chambers carved into stones. There are ancient chapels, food courts, and multi-purpose halls inside the carved rocks.

My initial plan was to visit the museum early in the morning before going back to Istanbul. However, I was not able to visit there until late afternoon. The irony is that "Goreme" literally means "be not able to see/visit" in Turkish. Fortunately, the museum was still open when I arrived and I was indeed *able to visit*.
