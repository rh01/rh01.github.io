我在中国河南读本科，目前我们家的经济情况不好，去年父母都下了岗，自己不但平时要省着用钱，暑期还要一边学习，一边找兼职工作（不能算有固定的收入），同时还要支付高昂的学费。我酷爱计算机科学，也非常希望学习这方面的东西，但是我们学校办课能力有限，很少有相关的课程可选。所以我想选贵校的课程，但是学费方面希望能得到贵校的帮助，这笔额外的开销我还要省吃俭用一个月。
I was an undergraduate student in Henan,Anyang and currently I have to face some financial problems. My parents have lost their jobs last year, so I do not have enough money every month and I have to find some part-time jobs during the summer vacation and other national festivals to pay the high tuition fees and make ends meet myself. I love computer science, and also very much like to learn something in this field, but the limited capacity of our school offering relevant lessons provide me few opportunities to study CS. So I want to choose your school's course, and also hope to get your school tuition help, this additional overhead will make me live frugally about a month.

我选择这门课程其实源于自己对于机器学习这个领域的强烈的兴趣，并也打算今后从事于这个领域的工作。我平时自学了很多关于机器学习的相关知识，自学过Andrew Ng斯坦福的公开课，也因此对于这个领域有了更加浓厚的兴趣以及强烈的执着。与此同时，我目前正在学习deep learning的相关知识，我感觉只要是能让计算机更加智能，更加人性化的东西，我都很感兴趣。不过鉴于我们学校本科这方面的课程太少，我还主动打听旁听过博士生的一些关于机器学习以及神经网络的课程。所以我更加希望可以学到这门课，并拿到贵校的证书，作为自己成果的证明。我对于这个领域感兴趣的内容很多，不过最感兴趣的是与大脑结合。因为我总有一种感觉，在未来机器学习等的人工智能的方法和人类本身的智能将有一个新的融合与突破，为探索人类的”禁区“——大脑做出不可磨灭的贡献。这门课程的认证证书对于我来说不单单是一个追求梦想的鼓舞，他同时也是我想要向我的朋友展示的理念——知识的海洋里，只有执着与否，从来没有”贵贱“之分。
In fact, I choose this course because of my strong interest in the machine learning field, and also intends to engage in this field in the future. I have already studied a lot about machine learning, and learned the open class about machine learning offered by Stanford, Andrew Ng. What's more although I am a junior student now, I am already doing some researches in this area. Making this world smarter and beautiful is my dream. So I choose this course.

I like many algorithms in AI and I admire the modes of thinking in this area. I also learned some courses about deep learning, and I was so impressed with magic power of this field.

Getting the certificate is a great help for me. It is not just an evidence for learning the course, but a proof that shows my strong faith to chase my dream. What's more it is also an evidence to get validation from others.

In fact, I choose this course because of my strong interest in this field, and also intends to engage in this field in the future. I have already studied a lot about probability and statistics. What's more although I am a junior student now, I am already doing some researches in relevant field. Making this world smarter and beautiful is my dream. So I choose this course.

I like many stochastic algorithms and I admire the models of regression. I also learned some courses about probability, and I was so impressed with its magic power of this field.

Getting the certificate is a great help for me. It is not just an evidence for learning the course, but a proof that shows my strong faith to chase my dream. What's more it is also an evidence to get validation from others.

为了证明我的学术诚信我将按时完成所留下的课业，积极参与课程的讨论，也会进我的所能通过QQ，e-mail等的渠道对于别人的疑问，积极发言（虽然不敢说自己的见解都是对的，但是我会积极把自己的想法说出来）。如果可以的话我会发起或者加入到别人创建的社区中，积极参加线下活动，交流思想与学习心得。如果我能有幸得到认证，我一定会努力完成课程，并拿到结业证书，同时我会在课后，通过各种渠道为Coursera做宣传。让更多的志同道合的人认识并加入我们的行列，让更多没有或者很少有机会接触到高等教育的人，了解并加入进来。 
To prove my academic integrity, I will complete all the assignments by myself on time, and actively participate in the discussion. I can also try my best to offer help to other people who study the same course. If I am lucky enough to get certified, I will also help to advertise the courses and share my experience to others.



and like-minded to join us, so that more have little or no access to higher education opportunities for people to learn and join in.




 QQ, e-mail and other questions for others to actively speak (though not say their views are right, but I will actively put their ideas to speak out). If you can, I will initiate or join others to create a community, and actively participate in offline activities, exchange of ideas and learning experiences. If I am lucky enough to get certified, I will strive to complete the course and get a certificate, but I will after school, doing publicity through various channels Coursera. Let more people know and like-minded to join us, so that more have little or no access to higher education opportunities for people to learn and join in.
